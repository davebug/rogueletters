# GitHub Setup Commands for Daily Letters

After creating your repository on GitHub, run these commands:

## Option 1: If your GitHub username is 'davebug' and repo is 'daily-letters':
git remote add origin https://github.com/davebug/daily-letters.git
git push -u origin main

## Option 2: Using SSH (if you have SSH keys set up):
git remote add origin git@github.com:davebug/daily-letters.git
git push -u origin main

## Option 3: If you named the repository something else, replace 'daily-letters' with your repo name:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git push -u origin main

## To verify the remote was added:
git remote -v

## If you need to change the remote URL later:
git remote set-url origin NEW_URL

## Current status:
- ✅ Local git repository initialized
- ✅ All files added and committed
- ⏳ Waiting to add remote and push

The repository is ready to push as soon as you create it on GitHub!
