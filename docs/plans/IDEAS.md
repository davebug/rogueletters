> **Not a plan.** Just ideas to revisit when designing future phases. Nothing here is committed.

## Modifier Ideas (2025-12-06)

### Board Modifiers
- Add more TW/DW/TL/DL squares to the board
- New square types? (e.g., "Star" = 2× word + 2× letter)

### Tile Value Boosts
- Boost letter points for specific tiles (Golden Q, Platinum Z)
- Category boosts: "All vowels +1", "All consonants +1"
- Uncommon letters (J, X, Q, Z) get bigger boosts

### Scoring Rule Changes
- Bingo threshold: 6-letter words instead of 7
- Increase bingo bonus amount
- New bonuses: "All different letters", "3+ same letter"

### Resource Increases
- More tiles in rack (7 → 8 → 9)
- More turns per round (5 → 6)
- Draw extra tile after playing 5+ letter word

### Economy Generators
- Specific tiles give +$1 when used in a word
- Surplus multiplier improvements
- Interest rate boosts

### Consumables
- Reroll rack tiles
- Skip a round (auto-pass)
- Mulligan: restart current round

## Economy — DECIDED (2025-12-06)

### Income (Finalized for Phase 2)
- **Base payout:** $3 (R1) → $4 (R2) → $5 (R3)
- **Surplus bonus:** +$1 per 10 points above target
- **No interest** — keeping it simple

### Shop Ideas (Phase 3+)
- 3 options offered per round
- If you buy one, the other two go up in price (interesting tension!)
- Pricing: one option always affordable with that round's earnings
- Special tiles with $ symbols that give money when used

### Pricing Tension
- Buy now at low price, or save for something better?
- Skipped items get more expensive - creates FOMO
- Can you afford to save up for expensive items?

## Open Questions

- How many modifiers before it feels overwhelming?
- Should modifiers be removable/replaceable?
- Visual treatment for modified tiles/squares?
- What's the right base payout progression?
- How much should skipped items increase in price?

## Currency Symbol (Future Polish)

Currently using `$` for simplicity. When polishing, consider switching to a thematic Unicode symbol:

| Symbol | Example | Vibe |
|--------|---------|------|
| `✦` | `✦47` | Mystical/arcane — **top pick** |
| `◆` | `◆47` | Clean gem/treasure, very readable |
| `Ɍ` | `Ɍ47` | Dollar sign but "Rogue" |
| `☠` | `☠47` | Maximum roguelike (maybe too edgy) |

**Recommendation:** `✦` — arcane feel, fits roguelike aesthetic, readable at small sizes.
