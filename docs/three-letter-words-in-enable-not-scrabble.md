### Why might these be excluded from Scrabble?

Many of these words appear to have been removed from the official Scrabble dictionary because:

1. **Offensive/Slur terms:** wog, wop, yid, hos, gyp, abo
2. **Terms that can be offensive:** jew (when used as verb), goy
3. **Abbreviations:** emf, fem, seg, les, lez
4. **Variant spellings:** gip (variant of gyp)

### Verification Needed

Each of these words should be individually verified at:

If the word shows "is not a playable word", it may have been intentionally removed from official Scrabble play due to being offensive, outdated, or not meeting dictionary standards.
